\title{Retrieve full provenance for a packaged code list (ICD9, ICD10, CPT).}
\usage{
codemetadata(
  dataset,
  file = system.file("extdata", "VERSIONS.yaml", package = "electronco")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Character. The dataset name to look up (e.g. "icd10").}

\item{file}{Character. Path to VERSIONS.yaml. Defaults to the installed package:
system.file("extdata", "VERSIONS.yaml", package = "electronco").}
}
\value{
Named list with the provenance record for \code{dataset}. If no match is
found, invisible NULL is returned and a warning is issued.
}
\description{
Reads the package VERSIONS.yaml (installed extdata) and returns the provenance
record for a single dataset as a named list. If the dataset was produced from
multiple sources the returned list preserves the \code{sources} sub-list and
includes combination metadata when present.
}
\examples{
# From installed package:
# codemetadata("icd10")

}
